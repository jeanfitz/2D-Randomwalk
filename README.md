# 2D-Randomwalk
Simulate a 2D Random walk in python (using numpy,matplotlib)

This basic python program simulates N steps of a unit 2D random walk in the plane
where N is chosen as input from the user and plots the result using Matplotlib.

Applications: Simulation, student learning and comparison to theoretical analytical results

Libraries used: numpy, matplotlib, random

User Notes: 
We use the random.seed with argument none but you could use the same seed to get the same result
each time using a particular number as argument.
